How about these slacks and this shirt? What do you think? How will Don look in this combination? Let's hope he'll pay a little attention to patterns and colors. How about this combination? That's better. Now a tie to go with the outfit and Don's all set. Don is putting one more finishing touch to his appearance. A well-matched outfit of clothes. How will he look?

So for each individual, the finishing touches of appearance may be his or hers alone, suited to individual needs, actions, ideas. After breakfast, Sue goes back to her room for some finishing touches. Her makeup. Her powder is one that blends with her natural coloring. She pats it on lightly, then carefully smooths it over her face. And be careful when it comes to lipstick. Yes. Choose a shade that goes with your own coloring and sets off your clothes to advantage. Then, easy does it. Now smooth out gently and wipe off any excess to leave only a smooth film of color, following the lines of your own lips. And finally, a last minute once over in the mirror. Make sure your hemline is even. Don't let your slip show. Come on, we'll be late. Oh boy, at the mirror again. Well the mirror could help you check your clothes too and improve your posture.
