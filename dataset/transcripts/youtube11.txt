 The End How do you do? May I help you? I would like to look at some shoes. Sit here, please. Thank you. Would you like to look at some shoes for your little girl? Yes, please. What size does she wear? I wear size six. No, dear, I think you wear a five and a half. Well, let me measure. Yes, that's right. She should wear size five and a half. What kind of shoes do you want? I want white shoes. Are you sure you want white shoes, Barbara? Yes, Mother. Look at some brown ones. Oh, no. I don't like brown. Mary has white shoes. I want shoes like hers. Well, I will get some white shoes and some brown shoes. Then you can try both pairs of shoes. Look at these, Mother. I like these shoes, Mother. These are sandals, Barbara. You can't wear sandals to school. Why, Mother? Well, don't you see they don't cover your foot? They're open all around, and they have a low, flat heel. They have straps, don't you see? May I try them on, Mother? Oh, no. They are for a bigger girl than you. They're not your size. I'm sorry, I don't have white shoes in size five and a half, but we have brown shoes and these black shoes. Would you like to try these? I want white shoes, Mother. Let's try these and see how they fit. There. Stand up and see how it feels. It doesn't feel good, Mother. Walk around and see how it feels. They look nice. It doesn't feel good. It hurts my foot. Do you have sandals? You can't wear sandals to school. I can show you shoes with straps. She can wear these to school. Thank you. May we see them? Are they sandals, Mother? No, dear. They are shoes. Wait. You will see them. I have two pairs. One pair with one strap and the other pair with two straps. Let me try the one with the one strap mother. These are pretty shoes and they're good shoes for school too. How much do they cost? They cost six dollars. Do these brown shoes cost six dollars? No, they cost four dollars and ninety-nine cents. How do they feel, Barbara? It fits her foot well. See how well it fits her foot around the heel? Do you like these shoes, Barbara? I don't know. They look funny, Mother. What do you mean, dear? I don't know. Just funny, Mother. Could I have some high heels, Mother? Oh, no, dear. they are not for little girls. I'm not a little girl mother, I'm nine years old. Oh hello Mary. Hello Barbara, are you getting some new shoes? Yes. Mr. Baker, my mother asked me to bring these shoes back to you. Thank you, Mary. Which pair of shoes did your mother keep for you? We like the brown shoes because they are best for school. Oh, then you're returning the white shoes. Yes, here they are. Thank you. Are you going to wear your new shoes to school tomorrow, Barbara? Yes. Are you going to wear yours? I think so. See you at school tomorrow. Goodbye, Barbara. Goodbye, Mary. Let me try on the brown shoes again, Mother. How do they feel, Barbara? They feel wonderful. Do they hurt your feet? Oh, no. I like these shoes. They're better for school. Do you want to wear them home, Barbara? Yes, Mother. Are they $4.99? Yes, $4.99 and 20 cents tax. That's $5.19. $5.19. Thank you. Here are her old shoes. Thank you. Oh, Mother, I like these brown shoes. Goodbye. Goodbye.
