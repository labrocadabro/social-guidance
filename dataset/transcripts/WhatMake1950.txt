 Hello, Eileen. This is Jean. I just had a letter from my brother, and guess what? He's bringing his roommate home from college. Mother said we can have a party for him, so I was wondering if you could come over tonight and help me plan it. Yes, Nora's coming too. This is one party that just has to turn out right. Well, the purpose of a party is to have fun together. And a successful party needs planning and skill. Whether it's a special carnival designed for gay entertainment, or a game party in a home, a birthday party, a holiday party, they all take planning, and they should all be fun. Now, the party Gene, Nora, and Eileen are planning. What of its purpose? The main idea is to introduce Steve to the gang. And show him a wonderful time. Yeah, and show everyone a nice time. Right. Now listen, this is what we have to plan. A guest list, invitations, refreshments, and entertainment. Now, a guest list. Who will we ask? There'll be the three of us on our dates, and I suppose we could have an extra couple and two extra girls for Jim and Steve Now, who do you think Nora? Well, let's have Allison Ted come they're nice and they're usually in our game Margie's lots of fun. The fellows would like her. That's right Eileen Unless it's asked dot. We certainly had a wonderful time at her party last month. Oh, I'll say Hmm. We all enjoy being together, but has anyone left out? I don't think so. Well, that's our guest list. Now, invitations. Should we write? Dear Alice, would you like to come to a party at my house Saturday, March 24 at 8 PM, and so on? Why bother to write? This is just an informal party. Let's just phone everyone. Sure. Good. We'll phone tomorrow. Next business refreshments. We have to feed the men. And the girls too. Especially you. Gee thanks. Does it show? Well we want something to eat and something to drink. Refresh me. How about hot chocolate and sandwiches? I'll fix the sandwiches. Well, thanks, Eileen. Suppose I talk it over with Mother and get her suggestions. All right. All right, now next is entertainment. We want to show Steve a good time, but, well, we don't know too much about what he likes. The best thing I know for breaking the ice and getting people acquainted is some good mixer games. Oh, but they can be such a bore if you don't have good ones. Well, let's go to the library and get some good magazines and books and find some really good games. Oh, terrific. I'll do that. Oh, good. And this party can just be an informal get-acquainted sort of party, and we'll have games for entertainment. Well, there are still many details to be planned, but the basic things are settled. Guest list, invitations, refreshments, entertainment. All these things should be planned to fit together well. It's the big night. The planning and preparation will help make a good party. But what else makes a good party? It's the skill of the hosts and the skill of the guests in making the party fun for everyone. Here we are, gang. Step right in. Hi, it's so nice to meet you. It's a pleasure. Finally meet you. Wonderful. First, getting everyone acquainted and into the spirit of the party. How's it done? Come in here, Steve. We'll wait here for the girls to put their coats away. Okay, Jean. Well, Steve, what do you think of our gang? What you've met of them, I mean. Oh, they's Gene's way of keeping you quiet. Come on, see. Margie and Dottie were just thrilled to think you college men would call for them. Oh, a couple of campus bigwigs we are. You bet your life. Oh, I think our guests are arriving. Excuse me. I hope you like our friends, Steve. Well, I hope they'll like me. They will. Hi, how are you? Hello, Eileen. Good to see you. Hi. Are we the first ones here? Oh, no, Margie and Dottie are here. Hi, Jean. How you been? Hello, Paul. I'm so glad you could come. Oh, you can't keep me away. Eileen, this is Steve. Hello, Steve. Hello, Eileen. Aren't you the party planner I've heard so much about? And this is Paula Johnson, our star tackle. How you doing Steve? Glad to know you Paul. Notice how Jean helps her guests get acquainted. Well the party is off to a good start. Guests are on time. Everyone's out to have fun and to help others fun. And when all the guests have arrived and have been introduced, the games begin. Well planned, well chosen games. First, a simple get together game. Each one may ask questions and try to guess his own identity. This mixes the group well, and besides, it provides a means of choosing partners for the next game. Having fun together makes a party. This means both hosts and guests. Whenever any of the guests begin to lose interest in a game, the host should start a new game so fun together can continue. And of course the guests have a part in this too. Each one should try to make the games fun. Each should take part in what the group is doing. And if some guests forget this, well anyone, even another guest, can help get the entire group together again. Nora, Jim started that hat making contest that you like so much. Come on! Take your hat and make a hat for her. And in the end we're going to give the prize to the best hat. Here are your materials. A hat making contest? Well, this will reveal some talent. The party is going well again. Have you noticed some of the skills of the guests that help keep the party fun for all? Let's look for others. And did you ever play rhythm? them or how about charades And then, at just the right moment... Is anybody hungry? Everything's ready. Is anybody hungry? Well, a little snack certainly is pleasant about this time of evening. Simple food, buffet style, an informal way to serve refreshments. Each one can serve himself and help the others too. And while everyone finishes eating, a little more spontaneous, unplanned fun. Oh, do you play, Steve? Does he play? Sure, Steve. Oh! Come on in a time. Jimmy Crack Corn, I don't care. Jimmy Crack Corn, I don't care. Jimmy Crack Corn, I don't care. The master's on the way. When I was young, I used to weigh on a scale. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care The master's on our way When I was young I used to wait On master and him display And pass the bottle when he got dry Rushed away to Lutale by Jimmy Crack Corn and I don't care Jimmy Crack Corn and I don't care Jimmy Crack Corn and I don't care away and part of a good party is knowing when to go home soon after refreshments have been served now let's think back what made this party such a good one? What do we want to do next time? If you are going to give a party, plan that party around a purpose. Choose your guests carefully. Plan invitations, plan for refreshments and entertainment. Then, practice to be a skillful host. Make sure the party is fun for everyone. And when you're invited to a party, practice the skills of a good guest. Be on time, ready for fun. Take part in the party. Help everyone around you to have a good time. Leave on time and courteously too, thanking your host sincerely for the good time you've had. All these things help to make a good party, a party that's fun for all. Oh, I don't care. Jimmy Crack Corn, I don't care. Jimmy Crack Corn, I don't care. The lantern's gone away.
