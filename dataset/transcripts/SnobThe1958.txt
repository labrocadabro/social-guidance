expression x to the ninth minus 3 squared. Come in. Hi, Mom. Hi. Still working so late? On Friday night? This is my last algebra problem. It'll save my history until tomorrow. Sarah. Sarah, your father and I appreciate the fact that you take your schoolwork seriously. But, well, couldn't you manage to arrange your time so you could have a little fun, too? I have a certain amount of homework to do, and I like to get it done on time. But you have the whole weekend. You could go out on Friday night or have somebody in. Like them? Is that what you mean? Having a good time is all I mean. And that's why I talked to Ron's mother the other day. You didn't. Well, I suppose you fixed it so he'd have to invite me over. I might have, if it had been necessary. But I found out that those Friday night get-togethers are open houses. You could go. I know I could if I wanted to. I don't. I think you should go. You're only young once and you... Mother, don't be so corny. There's nobody over there I want to see. I think I'd better finish my algebra. Of course, dear. We'll talk about this some other time. I'm glad to have you. Okay, Ron. Thanks. Take it easy. Your friends are certainly a nice bunch, Ron. Yeah, they're the greatest. Do you suppose they'd like to help you do something really nice? What do you mean, Mom? Well, how about being more friendly to Sarah Inman? Sarah Inman? Oh, Mom. No, really, dear, I mean it. You could invite Sarah over here next Friday to join us. Ask Sarah to come over here? Well, gee whiz, why? Don't you want her to come? No, I don't particularly want her. Sarah Inman. Now, Ron, you know we've always said that all of your friends are welcome here at any time. Well, I know, Mom, but... Well, the idea just kind of grew. We've got a large game room, well-stocked refrigerator, and lots of good records. So the gang started drifting in here on Friday. Nobody needed to be asked, but Sarah never came. She's too high hat for that. She wants a special invitation, and if she gets it, it'll be just one more reason for her to think she's better than anybody else. Now look here, Ron. Years ago when you had rheumatic fever, don't you remember who it was who came over here every day and read to you by the hour? Well, sure, Mom, but she's changed since then. Oh, no, Ron, I don't think she's really changed. Why don't you give her a chance? Well, she was good to me once. I guess I can ask her to honor us with her presence. I'll call her tomorrow. Thanks, son. You know, growing up brings different problems to different people. And some, well, they just don't quite bring it off without falling down somewhere. And some, well, they just don't quite bring it off without falling down somewhere. Well, if you ask me, where Sarah fell down was when she went into junior high. When she was in grade school, she was swell. She made good grades and had lots of friends. But when she started going to junior high with lots of other sharp kids, well, she couldn't be a big wheel. Now she's in senior high and. Oh, it's too bad. It seems, well, you know, it sounds like she needs a friend. You're nominating me? I don't know. She may cut me dead. She does lots of other people. And I don't think she cares at all hmm her highness has a new sweater ooh it's luscious you've got a hand in the Sarah she certainly has good taste the way she actually think nobody else else did. She'll hear you. That's an awfully pretty sweater, Sarah. Well, don't speak. Were you talking to me? Never mind. Hear nobody, see nobody, talk to nobody. That's Sarah. No wonder she had any fans. Hey, Ann Matson made secretary. Yeah, Jerry made vice president. Bill Tyler. That's great. Hey, congratulations, everybody. Congratulations. Hey, Bill made president. Jerry made vice president. Ann Matson made secretary. What's all the excitement? We're supposed to be election for next year's student council officers. Bill Tyler made president. I suppose you don't think Bill's the best man for the job? Oh, that girl. She's just sore because we picked Bill's design for the yearbook cover instead of hers. Let's go to class. I know you shoot us all out of the kitchen, but I don't mind drying dishes. Besides, I wanted to talk to you, Punkin. You did? You were so quiet during dinner. Something's bothering you. Care to cry on my shoulder? Daddy, there's nothing to cry about. Not one little thing? There are lots of little things we could talk about. But it wouldn't do any good. I'm waiting. Oh, all right. You'll think I'm silly. Well, this morning, when I came to class, I was worried about the history test first period. I was going over it in my mind and somebody spoke to me, Nancy Yeager. I didn't hear what she said, but she looked at me as if she just hated me. I worked hard on the history test, but I flubbed it. I know there are lots of people in there that don't study half as hard as I do. And they come off with the A's. I'm smarter than they are. I know I am. Last week, I worked just hours and hours on a design for the yearbook cover. Bill Tyler handed in just a blotchy sketch. I couldn't see anything to it. His design is going to be on the yearbook cover. This isn't fair. This afternoon, Ron from next door called and invited me over Friday night. I had to say yes because Mother's been pressuring me, but I don't want to go. Bill Tyler will be there, and I don't like him. President of student council. All the kids that get by on apple polishing will be there too and I don't like them. Punkin. I'm sorry you don't like so many people. Friends are important in this world. You should encourage others to make good and not dislike them for it. I think maybe your mother's right I think you should go to Ron's get-together this Friday Try to like people for whatever they are That's all the dishes I can clean out the sink Okay, pumpkin Just one more question. All these people you don't like, aren't they happier than you are? Aren't they happier than you are? Aren't they happier than you are? Food! Food for the stars! First choice goes to our new president. Look at them, playing up to him. Bill Tyler, big man. Everything he does is too, too clever. Makes me sick. I'm just as good as he is. No, I'm better. He was going to wear out first, me or the music. Who are you going to play next, huh? Why, I'm going around for a bit. Hey, how about it? Do you want to dance? I'd rather not. Well, you want to sit and talk then? I'd rather not. Not with you. Well, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you mad. Now, are you satisfied? I don't know what you're talking about. You really froze him out, didn't you? I don't know what business it is of yours if I don't want to dance. Well, I think you did want to dance. You wanted to dance, all right, but you just couldn't pass up the chance to be a snob. What's the matter? Sarah? Sarah, come back! I can't! Why not? What's the matter? Can I do anything? No. Oh, Ron, they're so mean and hateful. They don't understand anybody who isn't one of their gang and doesn't do all the silly things they do. They don't understand. Mean? Isn't there something I could do? The snob, hurting everyone, herself, her parents, her friends, other people. What makes Sarah act the way she does? Is it a cover-up for some lack she feels in herself? Can a friend like Ron help her in any way? Is the group justified in judging everything Sarah does as snobbery? What do you think?
