 A filmy dress, corsage to match, a handsome swain, and a lovely lady. That lights are soft, the music sweet, and you are with your favorite person. Will you enjoy this special evening among your friends? Will you really have a good time? Or will you be a little unsure, a little uncertain about the right thing to do and the right time to do it? Nothing spoils a good time like honey, and they gained confidence and poise thereby. By manners, we do not mean affectation. Good manners are really very simple. They come from knowing and following a set of symbols which help you enjoy yourself with people and help people enjoy themselves with you. It's as simple as that. Good manners, social graces, etiquette, call it what you will, all are based on consideration for others. Being kind to the other fellow in the little things of life, as well as the big things. The youngsters who start to learn their manners early are fortunate youngsters. They may not think so at the time, but as they grow older, they realize that good manners can't be put on for special occasions only. What better place to see yourself as up-see- you than in the school hall between classes? Good manners must be practiced as a part of everyday living until consideration for others becomes as much a part of you as your right arm or your two feet. If your manners aren't the everyday regular part of you, when special occasions do come up, you may be uncertain. Not show up to advantage, and sometimes your lack of assurance results in the embarrassment of doing the wrong thing. At the school cafeteria, show consideration for others. Take your place in line, wait your turn, don't hold up the path of progress while you compare notes on the exciting play in Saturday's game but move along as the line moves. Most school cafeterias serve a lot of people who are hungry at about the same time. If you have a choice of foods look at the menu as you come in so you won't hold up the line while you make your decision. Know how to choose a lunch that will help to keep you as bright as you are today and in all the days to come. And then comes time to pay. Oh what a line stopper this can be. That dime was in that pocket this morning but where oh where can it be now? Know what to eat as well as how to eat. While each lunch has variety to fit the taste of the individual, all the lunches follow the pattern of an A lunch. Each lunch includes about one-third of the protective foods needed for the day and features a substantial main dish or sandwich. Each lunch includes fruits and vegetables and milk because milk heads the list of favorite foods for lunchtime or any time for real refreshment. Consideration for others applies wherever you are, whether it be the corner hamburger stand, a simple dinner at home, or more formal dining. The rules are simple and are based on your hostess's consideration for you. Put your napkin in your lap quietly. Fancy flourishes are disturbing to those around you. No need to be uneasy about a long line of silverware. The first piece you use is placed on the outside, making it easy for you to pick up without spoiling the place setting. Automatically, the next piece you use is on the outside, making it easy to be sure of using the right piece for each course as it is served. Soup is eaten quietly from the side of the spoon. Good manners are based on common sense and are easy to acquire if you follow the simple rules. Salads are on your left and are eaten with the fork. And remember, the salad fork will be on the outside.
