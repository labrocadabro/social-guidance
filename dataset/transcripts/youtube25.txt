 Frank and his dog. One day not very long ago it was Saturday. You know how Saturdays are. Everyone has something to do. Yes, it's a very busy day. A good day to wash the car. And that is what Dad is doing. Frank, our son, has found something to do too. What do you suppose it is? Why, he is going to sweep out Penny's house. Penny is Frank's dog, you see. But here is Penny now. He wants to come through the gate, but we're all too busy to open it for him. Do you think he can open the gate by himself? Yes, he can. Penny looks around. He sees that everyone is very busy. And he wants to be very busy too. Well, here's something. Jean, will you play with me? I want to have something to do too. Come on, Jean, and play. Now, Penny, stop that, says Jean. Can't you see that I'm very busy? I have no time to play now. There now. Go away once and for all. But what is Penny up to now? Penny, what are you doing? Why, he's trying to play with the broom. Oh, no, you don't, says Frank. Now, Penny, stop that. I have work to do. I'm very busy, Frank says. Penny! Here, go chase this. Now, where did that stick go? Is it under these flower pots? Now, Penny, look what you've done. You've knocked over a flower pot. What am I going to do with you? No, it's no use begging. I have no time to play with you. Go away and find something to do. And so it's Saturday and everyone has something to do. Everyone but Penny. But what's this? What is Penny up to now? He sees himself in the hubcap. He wants to play. But Penny will only be in the way again. Go away, Penny, Father tells him. Nothing to do, says Penny. Everyone is just too busy to play with me i wish i could be busy too oh oh what's this why it's tabby mrs brown's tabby i wonder if i should Yes, I will. And up into the tree goes Tabby. Penny! Penny, Penny! But Penny is having fun. He is very busy now. Up he goes. And again. But who is this coming here? Oh, oh, it's Mrs. Brown. Tabby is Mrs. Brown's cat. Poor Tabby. Has Penny been mean to you? That's right, Penny. You just better go into your house and stay there. Mrs. Brown is very, very worried. She asks Father to help get Tabby down. But Tabby isn't so sure she wants to come down. Will Penny promise not to chase her again? There, Tabby. Everything's all right. We'll soon have you down out of that tree. There we are. Mrs. Brown is happy. Tabby is very happy. And so are Dad and I. But what about Penny? Penny, you're a bad dog, says Frank. We don't love you anymore. That's right. Go into your house and stay there. Look, what do you think I have on the tray I'm carrying? Cookies and lemonade. Cookies and lemonade for everyone, for we've all had a busy time. And Frank, here are some dog biscuits for Penny. Biscuits for bad Penny, asks Frank. Penny has been nothing but trouble all day long, Frank says. He's been in everyone's way. Why should he get any biscuits? You don't think he should get any, I ask Frank. Of course not, says Frank. He is a bad dog. No, Frank. What Penny did was bad. But Penny is not bad. And if we had taken time to play with him, perhaps he wouldn't have been so much trouble. Now go on over and make friends with him again. You're not a bad doggy, Penny. What you did just wasn't nice, Frank said. But I guess we weren't nice to you, were we? We love you, Penny. We always will.
