Your child can have all of this too. Do you really see your child when you look at him? Look at David, age 9. How straight he stands. Note his glossy hair, his good color, his broad chest with room for his lungs to breathe. David has none of those enlargements of bones of shoulder, chest, ribs, knees, and ankles due to poor bone growth. He has well-shaped knees. He stands on straight legs. He has beautiful feet with small ankle bones and fine arches. Straight toes, not kinked under like some of us. He has good muscles and uses them well, and is well because his parents have given him. Like David, little Milo has been breastfed since birth. Breast food is baby's best food. Milo, three months getting his daily exercise, already he raises himself up. Helen, getting her sun bath. At three months her back is well shaped. She holds her head erect. The straight lines down her side show good development. When baby is ready seven month old Bill delights in doing this.

At 13 months, Ann thrills her parents by taking her first step alone. Look at her broad chest and fairly flat tummy, though she has just had her dinner. Ann loves to stand holding to the buggy. Note her nice straight back, her straight lines down her side showing good development. She has a well-shaped head, good color, and abundant, glossy curls. Jimmy, the same age as Ann, is stockier built. His bones and muscles are heavier. He walks sooner, partly because he had more chance to cleat. All these preschool children have been well fed since birth and have good appetites. Agnes and Carl both two and a half years. Carl has a well-shaped head, glossy hair, and very good color. As he watches his dandelions sail away presently, see what fine teeth he has, how straight and even they are in his broad, well-developed jaw, which gives plenty of room for his second teeth.

Barbara and Joan are both seven years old. Joan, too, is well developed, but short and stalky. This older group shows differences in size and build. Harriet, the little one in the center, is 11 years old, and Marilyn, the largest, 13. This is David, nine years old, and Don, 12. Don is a thin, wiry type. David, whom we have met before, is heavy.
