If the pun is the lowest form of humor, I guess the practical joke is the oldest. You'll agree that most puns aren't very funny. The same thing goes for a big percentage of practical jokes. It's April Fool's Day, and these boys think they've dreamed up real killer. Very funny practical joke. What's the point of all this? The point is the handcuffs are just as tight and jail doors just as hard to open, whether you do something deliberately or whether you didn't mean to. Once you've been booked, printed, and your record is in the police files, statistically speaking, you're a member of that great brotherhood and sisterhood, the juvenile delinquents. Good intentions aren't enough. Good sense is a lot more useful. Yeah, but isn't there a difference between having a little fun and being bad? Everybody wants some fun once in a while. Well sure he does, but there's a difference between good fun and being stupid and careless or smart aleck and ignoring other people's right to enjoy life too. For instance, take a look at these three. They don't really need anything the owner of the store has for sale. But did you say something about having a little fun? It's a pretty old gag. Ethel needs something way in the rear of the store. While she keeps the owner busy, the boys steal what they want. But that isn't really stealing. It isn't? No. Sometime or other, every kid wants to swipe something just for the kick of it. You know, probably something you don't even need. Oh, then that makes it all right, eh? It's only stealing when you take something you need. Well... You see, the owner doesn't know they don't really need what they took. He thinks they stole it. And since he paid money for his merchandise, he wants it back. And he wants somebody punished. And Hank, Al, and Ethel got something, too. Brand-new police records. They've got a lot of company in the juvenile division files. These are the records of underage lawbreakers from just one large city. You're talking about these kids as if they were criminals. Well, what is a criminal? Somebody who breaks the law. If he does it often enough, he's a habitual criminal. According to the FBI, 15% of all arrests in this country are of boys and girls under 21. Every day, minors get involved with the law for the first time, usually just through thoughtlessness or carelessness or being wild. To go a bit highbrow, call it antisocial behavior. In a typical city, a special division of the police department with its own jail makes the first contact with boys being boys, but they remain here only a few hours at most. Depending on the seriousness of the complaint, they are either discharged or they are transferred to the juvenile hall under jurisdiction of the juvenile court. Here the idea is still not punishment, but rather to set a boy or girl back on the road to useful citizenship before habit-forming wildness can produce another community burden, another hardened habitual criminal. Probation officers handle every delinquency case as a separate problem, like a doctor prescribing treatment. They try to restore the kind of attitude that makes a normal, right-thinking boy or girl. If they fail, well, there are jails all over the country full of failures. Not only probation officers' failures, but men and women who failed themselves when they were growing up. Yeah, that's all swell. But kids still have to have some fun. Everybody's a little wild until they grow up, then they settle down. That's very true. But there's a's a difference between being wild as you put it and being a menace to the community when a boy or girl reaches high school like Ben and Dave here he's right at the age when he should start learning some of the responsibilities that go along with the privileges in a country like this these boys are both from good homes both with good school records, but both, as you say, a little wild. And they've just been invited to a Halloween party. Still, you can't get into much trouble at a party, even a Halloween party, though some try. First, our friends Dave and Ben spike the punch. But that's an old stale trick and there isn't enough excitement in it. Then they let the air out of the tires of a few cars. That's pretty tame, too. But give them credit, they're progressing. The trouble is, everything they get away with makes Ben and Dave that much bolder. Now they want to do something really good. And remember, they're just a little wild. Ben notices something about the car. Actually, the owner broke the law. He left the keys in the car. It really isn't up to Ben and Dave to teach him a lesson, but if they decide to do it, it'll teach him a real one. Do what? Why, steal his car. So it's happened. This isn't small chain stuff anymore. They've graduated into the big leagues. As the police say, grand theft auto. Of course, they're thinking to themselves, it isn't really stealing, they just borrowed a car. They intend to bring it back to where they found it. It's just a Halloween joke. They're getting bolder too, driving a stolen, pardon me, a borrowed car right into a drive-in stand. Ben's new idea was that they wouldn't have to pay, that even if the car hop took the license number, it would be traced not to Ben and Dave, but to the owner of the car. Another joke. Well, Ben and Dave don't know it yet, but their little joke is about over. You see, in the meantime, the owner has reported his car stolen, and it was listed on the hot, they knew they were really in a spot. They knew they only borrowed the car, but the owner didn't, and the police didn't. So they've made another mistake, trying to get away instead of surrendering. Now, as far as the police are concerned, they could be dangerous criminals, and the officers will take any measures necessary to get them. Well, that's it. It started with a Halloween joke spiking the party punch, and it ends with two boys in jail. Did you read about it? You see, this is a true story. Well, that's all it takes. You don't have to be bad or some freak known as a delinquent to get into trouble. All it takes is stupidity or carelessness or a disregard for other people's rights. Sure, you may get away with irresponsibility and let somebody else carry your load for a while, but eventually it's going to catch up with you. And being young, underage isn't going to be enough of an alibi. Sometimes you're not in a position to explain that you didn't mean it. You know, actually, we have it pretty special in a country like this, but everybody is expected to do his share. If he doesn't, well, society will take care of him eventually, whether he's just a wild kid or his older brother or sister, the habitual criminal. So don't take silly chances with your own future. It just isn't worth it.
