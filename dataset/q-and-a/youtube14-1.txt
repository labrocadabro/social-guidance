        "answer": "Adjusting your budget to accommodate unexpected expenses involves flexibility, adaptability, and strategic planning. Start by creating a budget that includes a contingency fund or emergency savings to cover unforeseen costs.

Consider temporarily reducing discretionary expenses, such as entertainment or personal items, to free up money for the unexpected cost. It's important to prioritize essential expenses and savings goals while making adjustments to your budget. If the unexpected expense is significant, you may need to revise your savings timeline or cut back on non-essential purchases until you can replenish your emergency fund. By being proactive, flexible, and resourceful, you can navigate unexpected financial challenges while staying on track towards your long-term financial objectives."
