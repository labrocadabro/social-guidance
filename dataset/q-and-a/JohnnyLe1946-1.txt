        "answer": "Developing good habits and manners involves making a conscious effort to be considerate and well-mannered in your daily interactions. Start by keeping your personal space clean and tidy, such as hanging up your clothes and putting away your toys. Practicing good hygiene, like cleaning your teeth properly and keeping your bathroom tidy, is also important.

By practicing good manners regularly, such as sitting up straight at the table, using utensils properly, and being polite, you can develop these habits over time. It's important to act immediately and consistently to make positive changes in your behavior, so you can become a better version of yourself and earn the respect of those around you."
