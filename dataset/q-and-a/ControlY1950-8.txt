        "question": "How can I better control my emotions?",
        "answer": "To better control your emotions, it is important to understand the stimulus-response pattern. When you have certain experiences, you respond with various emotions. Recognize the patterns of your emotional responses and try to eliminate or modify the stimulus that triggers them. If you can't eliminate the stimulus, try to modify it by looking at the situation from a different perspective. Additionally, you can modify your response by substituting anger with humor or a more positive outlook. By understanding your emotions and those of people around you, you can develop better control over your emotional behavior. This will lead to straighter thinking, less muddled actions, and overall greater happiness for yourself and those around you."

        "question": "How does uncontrolled emotional behavior impact decision-making?",
        "answer": "Uncontrolled emotional behavior can significantly impact decision-making abilities. When emotions like anger, fear, or love are not kept in check, they can cloud judgment, lead to impulsive decisions, and hinder rational thinking. In the example of Jeff losing control of his emotions, his muddled thinking and careless actions resulted in poor decision-making and potential consequences. Emotional stress can decrease efficiency, distort perceptions, and affect logical reasoning. By allowing emotions to dictate behavior, individuals may make choices they later regret or that have negative outcomes. It is essential to maintain emotional control to ensure sound decision-making and positive results in various aspects of life."
