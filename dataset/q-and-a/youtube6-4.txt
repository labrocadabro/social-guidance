        "question": "How do social controls like custom, moral code, and law affect our daily lives?",
        "answer": "Social controls such as custom, moral code, and law play a significant role in guiding our actions and behaviors in our daily lives. Customs are the usual behaviors we follow, such as dressing neatly and being courteous to others. Violating customs may result in a loss of prestige, as we tend to follow these habits regularly. Moral codes, or mores, are society's standards of what is considered right and wrong. For example, not cheating in games or refraining from drinking and gambling at the teen canteen are aligned with the moral code of the group. Breaking moral codes can lead to a loss of social status and belonging. Law, on the other hand, is a set of rules made by representatives of the people and enforced through established means. Laws prohibit what the majority deem wrong and direct what is considered right. For instance, laws require individuals to attend school for personal and societal benefit. Overall, social controls like custom, moral code, and law shape our conduct and interactions within our families, schools, communities, and beyond."

        "answer": "It is important for communities to have their own laws and regulations to maintain order, establish norms, and govern behaviors within the group. Community-specific laws help set boundaries and expectations for conduct, ensuring that members abide by shared rules and values. By having their own laws, communities can address specific needs, concerns, and circumstances unique to their group. These laws promote cohesion, respect, and accountability among members, fostering a sense of belonging and collective responsibility. Additionally, community laws help prevent conflicts, maintain social harmony, and provide a framework for resolving disputes or issues that may arise. By creating and enforcing their own laws, communities can govern themselves independently and make decisions that align with their values and interests, ultimately contributing to a well-functioning and organized society."
