        "question": "How can I write a good social letter?",
        "answer": "Writing a good social letter involves understanding the purpose of the letter and tailoring your message accordingly. There are different types of social letters, such as invitations, thank you letters, friendly letters, and letters of sympathy. For formal invitations, make sure to respond in the third person and dress appropriately for the occasion. Informal invitations do not always require a response. Thank you letters should express genuine gratitude and mention specific details about the gift or visit. Friendly letters should include personal anecdotes or news to maintain a connection. When writing letters of sympathy, be informal and comforting. When drafting a letter, consider the recipient's feelings and how you want them to react after reading your letter. Use proper formatting, including your address, date, salutation, main content, and signature. Focus on making your message clear, sincere, and personalized to create a positive impact on the recipient."
