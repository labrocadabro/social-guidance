        "question": "How can I improve my table manners?",
        "answer": "Improving table manners involves practicing common courtesy, consideration for others, and using common sense. Start by using silverware from the outside in, with the outermost utensils for salad, main course, and dessert. Remember to hold the fork correctly and place only one mouthful of food on it. Park the fork after use and hold the knife properly to cut meat without tearing it. When finished, place the knife and fork in a specific way on the plate. For spoon foods like soup, dip away from yourself, eat from the side of the spoon, and avoid tipping the bowl. Practice these habits regularly at home so they become second nature and watch others with good manners to learn proper etiquette."
