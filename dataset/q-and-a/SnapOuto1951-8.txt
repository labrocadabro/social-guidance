        "question": "How can one handle disappointments effectively?",
        "answer": "Handling disappointments effectively involves understanding that sometimes our expectations may not be realistic. It's important to figure out what's possible or reasonable, and then aim high while not counting on it. When disappointments come, it's crucial to not let them affect your ability to study or work towards your goals. Instead, channel your emotional energy into a direct attack on the problem at hand. Just like in basketball, where players who face obstacles don't withdraw or give up, but become more alert and work at it until they succeed. By playing actively and keeping emotions in balance, you can effectively handle disappointments and continue to strive for improvement."

By managing your emotional reactions and focusing on what you can do to improve or address the situation, you can navigate disappointments with resilience and continue working towards your goals."
