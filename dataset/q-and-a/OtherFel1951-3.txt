        "question": "How can I handle teasing from others?",
        "answer": "Dealing with teasing from others can be tough, but it's important to remember that most teasing starts as harmless banter. However, if the teasing starts to affect you negatively, it's crucial to speak up and let the person know that their actions are hurting your feelings. If the teasing persists and becomes hurtful, it's essential to seek help from a teacher, parent, or another trusted adult. Retaliating or getting even with the teaser is not the best course of action, as it can escalate the situation further. Remember, it's okay to stand up for yourself and seek help when needed, as no one should have to endure teasing that causes distress."
