        "question": "How can I ensure my child grows up to be healthy and happy?",
        "answer": "To ensure your child grows up to be healthy and happy, it is crucial to provide them with proper nutrition, sunlight, companionship, and intelligent care from infancy. Breastfeeding your baby since birth is highly beneficial, as breast milk is considered the best food for infants. Encourage daily exercise for your child, starting from a young age, as physical activity contributes to healthy development. Additionally, allow your baby to reach milestones on their own, such as sitting up, to promote natural growth. Providing ample space for your baby to crawl and explore is essential. As your child grows, introduce a variety of nutritious foods into their diet, including milk, oranges, cabbage, potatoes, green and yellow vegetables, dried fruits, eggs, fish, and whole-grain cereals. It is important to offer a well-balanced diet to support their growth and development. Lastly, ensure your child receives plenty of sunlight, fresh air, and love and kindness, as these factors play a significant role in shaping healthy, well-balanced, and efficient individuals."
