        "question": "What should be done when receiving an invitation that is not suitable?",
        "answer": "When receiving an invitation that is not suitable, it is important to respect the decision of those in charge, such as parents or guardians. It is essential to accept their decision gracefully and not argue or try to manipulate the situation. Instead, consider proposing an alternative plan that is more acceptable to everyone involved. This shows maturity and respect for the rules set in place by the family. By suggesting a compromise, such as having the event at home instead of going out, you demonstrate flexibility and understanding of the concerns raised by the initial invitation. Ultimately, it is crucial to handle the situation with poise and understanding, rather than defiance or resistance."
