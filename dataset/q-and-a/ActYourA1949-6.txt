        "question": "How can one address infantile reactions and ensure they act maturely?",
        "answer": "Addressing infantile reactions involves first identifying instances where one's behavior may be immature or childish. This could include reacting strongly to losing, constantly seeking attention, being unable to handle jokes at one's expense, or crying over minor issues. Once these behaviors are recognized, it's important to understand that different parts of one's personality may grow at different rates, leading to inconsistencies in behavior. By rating oneself on how one reacts in specific situations, individuals can pinpoint areas for improvement and track their emotional growth over time. Seeking feedback from others, like parents or friends, can also provide valuable perspectives on areas that may need attention. Developing self-control, resilience, and the ability to handle challenging situations with maturity are essential in addressing infantile reactions and ensuring one acts in a more grown-up manner. By actively working on these aspects, individuals can gradually shed childish behaviors and cultivate a more mature demeanor."
