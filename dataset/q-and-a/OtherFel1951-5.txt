        "question": "How can I handle teasing or bullying?",
        "answer": "Dealing with teasing or bullying can be tough, but there are ways to handle it. One approach is to talk to the person teasing you and let them know that their behavior is hurtful. Sometimes, people don't realize the impact of their actions until it's brought to their attention. If the teasing continues, it's important to seek help from a trusted adult, like a teacher or parent, who can help address the situation. Retaliating or getting even with the person teasing you may only make things worse, so it's best to avoid that route. Remember, it's not your fault if someone is teasing you, and you have the right to feel safe and respected. Surround yourself with supportive friends who can help you navigate through the situation, and don't be afraid to seek help if needed. It's essential to stand up for yourself and set boundaries to ensure your well-being."

When disagreements arise, it's essential to communicate openly and honestly with the other person involved. Express your feelings and listen to their perspective to understand where they're coming from. Avoid resorting to name-calling or hurtful language, as this can escalate the conflict further.

If the conflict persists, consider involving a mediator, such as a teacher or counselor, to help facilitate a constructive conversation.
