        "question": "How do social controls like law, custom, and moral code influence our behavior?",
        "answer": "Social controls such as law, custom, and moral code play a crucial role in guiding our behavior and actions. Custom dictates what we usually do, establishing norms and expectations within a community. For example, dressing neatly and being courteous are common customs that we follow. Moral code sets the standards of what we should and should not do, representing deeper societal values. Breaking moral codes can lead to a loss of social status and belonging.

Laws prohibit actions considered wrong by the majority, while also directing what is considered right. For instance, laws require us to attend school for the benefit of both ourselves and society. In summary, social controls like law, custom, and moral code shape our behavior by providing guidelines, standards, and consequences that influence our actions in various social contexts."
