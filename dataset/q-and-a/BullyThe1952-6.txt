        "question": "Are you really so brave or are you the one who is afraid?",
        "answer": "Bravery is not about exerting power over others or instilling fear in them. True courage lies in being able to face challenges and adversities with integrity and empathy. Bullying or intimidating behavior often stems from insecurity and fear, rather than actual bravery. It takes strength to be kind, respectful, and considerate towards others, even in the face of pressure or negative influences. So, ask yourself, are you truly brave in your actions, or are you masking your fears with harmful behavior?"
