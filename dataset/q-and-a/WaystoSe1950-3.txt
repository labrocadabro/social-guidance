Sometimes misunderstandings can lead to conflicts, so taking the time to gather all the necessary information can clear up any confusion. Lastly, seeking the opinions of others, whether through an expert or a group vote, can be a fair way to settle disagreements and ensure that everyone's voice is heard."
