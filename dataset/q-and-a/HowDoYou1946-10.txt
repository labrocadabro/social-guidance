        "question": "How should I properly introduce people?",
        "answer": "Properly introducing people is a simple matter of following a few basic rules. When introducing a man to a woman, always address the woman first. For example, you can say, 'Miss Cameron, this is my father. How do you do, Miss Cameron?' If introducing persons of the same sex, it's important to show respect by addressing the older individual first. Remember to keep introductions simple and to the point, avoiding awkward phrases like 'meet so-and-so.' Additionally, when responding to an introduction, stick to the accepted form of a simple 'how do you do?' with a comfortable, firm handshake for men. Women should not initiate a handshake with a man unless he offers his hand first. Always remember to rise when being introduced or introducing someone, showing that it is a pleasure and not a hardship. Practice these basic rules and soon they will become second nature, making it easier to navigate social situations with ease."

Similarly, a woman should rise when introduced to someone, especially if the person being introduced is standing. By rising during introductions, you show that you are attentive, respectful, and ready to engage in the interaction. Remember, practicing these small gestures of courtesy can make a big difference in how you are perceived in social situations."
