        "question": "How can one ensure they are dressed appropriately for a formal event?",
        "answer": "Dressing appropriately for a formal event involves understanding the principles of style and good taste. Style is not the same as fashion, which changes, but rather the use of definite principles of design. It doesn't require expensive clothes but does require good taste and an understanding of how to enhance one's personality through clothes. Style involves using lines, colors, fabrics to emphasize good features and mask less attractive ones. For example, horizontal lines can break a tall figure, while vertical lines can heighten a short figure. The choice of colors and fabrics can impact how one's figure is perceived. It is essential to choose clothes that suit one's personality and figure, focusing on good design principles. By understanding these principles and using them effectively, one can ensure they are dressed appropriately for a formal event, exuding confidence and elegance."
