        "question": "How can I ensure safety in social situations?",
        "answer": "Ensuring safety in social situations involves being aware of potential dangers and making responsible decisions. For example, when near water with potential risks like sharks, it's important to remember not to swim to avoid any harm. Similarly, not running out into the street where cars might hit you is another example of using common sense to stay safe. These safety measures are not rules, but rather common sense practices that help prevent accidents and injuries. It's important to think about the consequences of your actions and prioritize safety in all social situations to protect yourself and others around you."
