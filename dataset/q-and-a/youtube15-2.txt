        "question": "How can we show people that exceptions to rules are unfair?",
        "answer": "Exceptions to rules can create an unfair advantage for some individuals while disadvantaging others. This can lead to a breakdown in the fairness of the system and disrupt the balance that rules are meant to establish. By highlighting the negative impact that exceptions can have on the overall integrity of the rules, individuals can be shown that exceptions undermine the purpose of having rules in the first place. Drawing parallels to everyday scenarios, such as sports or traffic laws, can help people understand that exceptions can lead to confusion, unfairness, and ultimately spoil the game for everyone involved. Emphasizing the importance of consistency and equal treatment under the rules can further reinforce the idea that exceptions have the potential to erode the fundamental principles of fairness and equity that rules aim to uphold."
