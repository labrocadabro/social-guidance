        "question": "How can I communicate effectively when I'm angry?",
        "answer": "Effective communication when angry involves expressing your feelings in a clear and respectful manner. Instead of resorting to yelling or aggressive behavior, take a moment to calm yourself down before addressing the issue. Use 'I' statements to express how you feel without blaming the other person. For example, say 'I feel upset when...' instead of 'You always make me angry.' Listen actively to the other person's perspective and try to understand their point of view. Avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions, and ask clarifying questions to ensure you have a complete understanding of the situation. Practice active listening by summarizing what the other person has said and reflecting on their emotions. By communicating calmly and assertively, you can resolve conflicts more effectively and prevent misunderstandings that lead to anger."
