        "answer": "To get to know the children in your class better, start by using your eyes and ears to observe their behaviors and interactions with others. Take note of their strengths, weaknesses, and any unique characteristics they may have. Utilize controlled observation, where you try different approaches based on your observations to learn more about each child's needs and characteristics. Review their cumulative records to understand their academic performance, health status, and any other relevant information.

Arrange parent interviews when necessary to gain a deeper understanding of a child's home environment. Conduct staff conferences to brainstorm solutions for particularly challenging cases. Ultimately, the key is to combine your sense perceptions with common sense and empathy in order to build meaningful relationships with each child."
