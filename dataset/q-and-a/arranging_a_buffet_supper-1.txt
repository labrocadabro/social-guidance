        "question": "How should I arrange a buffet supper table for guests?",
        "answer": "Arranging a buffet supper table involves several key considerations to ensure your guests can serve themselves without any issues. Start by using a plain linen tablecloth laid out squarely and smoothly, with the sides hanging evenly. A centerpiece of fruits can be placed in the center of the table to add an attractive touch. Remember not to place candles on the table if they are not the principal light source. Next, place items around the table in the order in which each guest will help themselves, starting with napkins and forks. Staggering the forks will make it easier for guests to pick them up. Ensure that the main dishes are spaced around the table to allow guests ample room to serve themselves without feeling crowded. Keep rolls warm in a napkin and buttered in the kitchen to make it easier for guests. Finally, serve dessert on separate plates and include the necessary utensils. By following these steps, you can create a pleasing and proper meal arrangement for your guests, showing consideration and respect for their dining experience."
