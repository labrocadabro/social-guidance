        "question": "How can I show consideration for others when they want to play with me?",
        "answer": "When someone wants to play with you, it's important to be considerate of their feelings and needs. If you are busy and cannot play at that moment, it's best to kindly explain that you have other things to do and suggest playing at a later time. Avoid being dismissive or rude, as this can hurt the other person's feelings. Remember, it's important to treat others the way you would want to be treated. If you find yourself in a situation where you are unable to play with someone, try to find a compromise or alternative activity that can include them later on. By showing kindness and understanding, you can maintain positive relationships with others and avoid making them feel neglected or unimportant."

Instead of getting frustrated or upset, calmly explain to the person that you have tasks to complete and need space to do so.
