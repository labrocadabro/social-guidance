        "question": "How can I make introductions with respect and courtesy?",
        "answer": "When making introductions, it is important to show respect and courtesy by following certain etiquettes. Begin by mentioning the name of the person who holds a higher position or is older, as a sign of respect. For instance, when introducing your mother and teacher, mention your mother's name first and then the teacher's name. When introducing individuals of the same age, you can choose either name to begin with. Remember to present each person to the other, creating a smooth flow for the conversation to begin. Handshakes are another aspect of introductions that should be done with care - avoid squeezing too hard or offering a limp handshake. Making introductions with respect not only shows your understanding of social norms but also helps in establishing a positive and courteous atmosphere in social settings."
