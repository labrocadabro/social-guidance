        "question": "How can we help young people grow up emotionally?",
        "answer": "Helping young people grow up emotionally involves understanding that different parts of their personalities grow at different rates. Some individuals may never fully grow up emotionally because one side of their personality remains infantile. To assist in this growth process, it is crucial to identify infantile reactions, such as constantly needing to win arguments, being unable to take a joke, showing off for attention, crying over trifles, or becoming excessively angry when facing defeat. By recognizing these behaviors, individuals can work on maturing the underdeveloped parts of their personalities. A method to measure emotional growth can be through self-assessment. By rating oneself in situations like disagreements, jokes at one's expense, moments of confusion, not getting what one wants, and controlling temper when things don't go as planned, individuals can monitor their emotional maturity and work towards balancing out their personality growth. Encouraging self-reflection and self-improvement in these areas can help young people develop emotional maturity and eliminate infantile reactions."
