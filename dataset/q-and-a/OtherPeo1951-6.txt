        "question": "How can I make responsible decisions and avoid getting into trouble?",
        "answer": "Making responsible decisions involves stopping to think about the consequences of your actions before carrying them out. Consider how your choices might impact others around you and whether it aligns with your values. It's important to listen to your inner voice when you feel that something is wrong and have the courage to speak up or walk away from a situation, even if it means going against your friends.

Reflect on past experiences, like the story of the three boys, and learn from their mistakes to avoid getting into trouble. Ultimately, being responsible means putting the well-being of others above your desire for momentary excitement or peer approval."
