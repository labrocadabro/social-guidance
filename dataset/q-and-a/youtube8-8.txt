        "question": "How do children learn to navigate their emotional responses?",
        "answer": "Children learn to navigate their emotional responses through living with others and experiencing different situations. From the moment a child is born, they are capable of being happy, unhappy, and making others feel the same way. As they grow, they learn to develop emotional responses to events around them, based on how they are handled, spoken to, comforted, or provoked by others. Children learn by reacting emotionally to what they see, hear, and touch, and by responding to cues in their environment. By trying, testing, accepting, and rejecting, children learn to manage their emotional responses and develop emotional maturity through experience."

        "question": "What role do emotions play in everyday experiences?",

From the moment a child is born, they are equipped with the capacity for emotions, which can influence their happiness, unhappiness, and the feelings of those around them.
