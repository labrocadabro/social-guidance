Start by making sure you have the correct number before dialing to avoid wasting time and disturbing others. Wait for the dial tone before dialing to ensure your call goes through properly. When speaking on the phone, be clear and speak directly into the mouthpiece, avoiding distractions like gum or food in your mouth. Answer incoming calls promptly and identify yourself and your office to the caller to make the conversation more efficient. Always end the conversation politely and put the phone back securely on its base after hanging up. For long-distance calls, stay near the phone until the call goes through and inform the operator where you can be reached if you have to leave your office. When transferring calls, make sure the customer is directed to the right department to save time and energy for both parties. Lastly, remember that your voice tone can make a big impression, so speak with a smile in your voice to convey interest and warmth to the caller.
