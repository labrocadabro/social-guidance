        "question": "How can I maintain academic integrity?",
        "answer": "Maintaining academic integrity involves being honest and doing your own work. Cheating not only harms your academic reputation but also affects those around you. It's important to study and prepare for tests on your own, rather than relying on others to provide you with answers. If you find yourself struggling with a subject, seek help from teachers or tutors instead of resorting to cheating. Remember that cheating not only undermines your own learning but also devalues the accomplishments of your peers. By being honest and working hard, you can earn your grades and the respect of others, without compromising your integrity."

        "question": "How can I avoid depending too much on others for my responsibilities?",
        "answer": "Avoiding dependence on others for your responsibilities involves taking ownership of your tasks and obligations. While it's natural to seek help and support from friends or colleagues, it's important not to rely on them to do your work for you. Make a conscious effort to manage your time effectively and prioritize your commitments. If you find yourself constantly leaning on others to fulfill your responsibilities, you risk diminishing your own capabilities and credibility. By being proactive, organized, and self-reliant, you can demonstrate your competence and earn the trust of those around you. Remember, true success comes from your own efforts and abilities, not from relying on others to carry your load."
