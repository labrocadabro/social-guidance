        "question": "How can I improve my table manners?",
        "answer": "Improving your table manners involves sitting up straight, using your napkin properly, and asking for food to be passed to you instead of reaching for it. Make sure to eat like a little gentleman, without slurping, spilling, or splashing food. Remember to be proud of your good manners and show gratitude towards others at the table. By acting polite and well-mannered, you are not being a sissy, but rather showing respect and consideration for those around you. Listening to bad advice that promotes rudeness and selfishness will not get you anywhere, so it's important to choose the right path. Excusing yourself from the table when you are done and leaving in a respectful manner is also part of displaying good table manners. Remember, any drip can be a pig, but it takes a smart person not to be one."
