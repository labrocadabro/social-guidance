        "question": "How can exercise contribute to better mental health?",
        "answer": "Exercise plays a significant role in promoting better mental health by reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. Physical activity triggers the release of endorphins, also known as 'feel-good' hormones, which can elevate your mood and create a sense of well-being. Regular exercise helps to alleviate symptoms of mental health conditions by enhancing brain function, improving cognitive abilities, and boosting self-esteem. Engaging in physical activities like sports, yoga, or aerobic exercises can act as a natural stress reliever and provide a healthy outlet for pent-up emotions. By incorporating exercise into your daily routine, you can effectively manage emotional tension, enhance your focus and concentration, and increase your overall mental resilience. It's essential to prioritize your mental health by making time for physical activity, as it can have long-lasting benefits on your emotional well-being and psychological state. Remember to listen to your body, set realistic goals, and seek professional guidance if needed to ensure a safe and effective exercise routine for optimal mental health."
