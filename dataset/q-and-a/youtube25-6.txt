        "question": "How can I ensure I am considerate of others around me?",
        "answer": "Being considerate of others involves paying attention to their needs and feelings. It's important to remember that everyone has their own responsibilities and tasks to complete. Before asking someone to play or engage in an activity with you, take a moment to observe if they are busy or occupied with something else. If you notice that they are preoccupied, it's best to wait for a more suitable time to approach them. Additionally, being considerate means not interrupting or disrupting others when they are in the middle of a task. Instead, try to find ways to occupy yourself or be productive without causing a disturbance. By being mindful of others' time and commitments, you can show that you respect their boundaries and priorities. Remember, everyone appreciates when you take their feelings into account and make an effort to avoid inconveniencing them."
