        "question": "How do social controls like custom, moral code, and law affect our daily lives?",
        "answer": "Social controls like custom, moral code, and law play a significant role in regulating our daily lives. Custom dictates what we usually do, setting the tone for our actions. It guides us in following established practices and behaving in a manner that is considered acceptable by society. Moral code, on the other hand, outlines what we should do, providing a set of standards that govern our behavior based on societal norms. It influences our decisions and helps us distinguish between right and wrong. Law, as the most formal form of social control, mandates what we must do, setting legal boundaries that must be adhered to. It ensures that individuals act in accordance with the rules and regulations set by society. Together, these social controls shape our interactions, behaviors, and decisions, guiding us towards living harmoniously within our communities."
