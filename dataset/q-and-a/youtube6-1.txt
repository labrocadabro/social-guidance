        "question": "How do social controls like custom, moral code, and law affect our daily lives?",
        "answer": "Social controls like custom, moral code, and law play a significant role in regulating our daily lives. Custom dictates what we usually do, setting norms for behavior such as dressing neatly and being courteous to others. Violating customs may result in losing a bit of prestige, but they largely guide our habits. Moral codes, on the other hand, represent society's standards of what should and should not be done. These standards are deeply ingrained in us, shaping our actions like not cheating in games or refraining from drinking or gambling. Breaking moral codes can lead to a loss of social status and exclusion from a group. Law, the third form of social control, consists of rules for conduct created by representatives of the people and enforced by established means. Laws prevent what the majority deems as wrong and direct what is considered right. For example, laws require attending school for the benefit of you and society. Ultimately, social controls influence our interactions in family, school, church, and the broader community, guiding our behavior at various levels of society."

        "question": "Why is it important to adhere to customs, moral codes, and laws in society?",
        "answer": "Adhering to customs, moral codes, and laws in society is crucial for maintaining social order and harmony. Customs, such as being neat and courteous, establish norms that help us navigate daily interactions. While violating customs may have minor consequences, they largely shape our habits and social behaviors. Moral codes set standards for what is deemed right or wrong by society, guiding our actions and decisions. Breaking moral codes can result in social repercussions, leading to exclusion from groups. Laws, as the formalized rules for conduct, direct individuals on what is permissible and impermissible in a community. Upholding laws ensures that society functions smoothly by preventing harmful behaviors and promoting positive actions. By following customs, moral codes, and laws, individuals contribute to a cohesive and well-functioning society where everyone's rights and responsibilities are respected."

        "question": "How does the majority influence the creation and enforcement of laws in a community?",
        "answer": "The majority in a community plays a significant role in the creation and enforcement of laws. When new laws or rules are under consideration, the majority's opinions and votes often determine the outcome. For example, in the teen canteen discussed in the video, the majority of members voted to set the closing time at 10:30 on weeknights. This decision was influenced by various factors, including the convenience of the cleanup committee, aligning with town customs, and ensuring compliance with existing laws. The majority's support for a specific law reflects the collective values and beliefs of the community. In a democracy, laws and social controls are owned by the people who live under them, empowering the majority to make informed decisions about regulations that impact society. By considering the opinions and perspectives of the majority, communities can create laws that reflect the shared values and promote the well-being of all members."
