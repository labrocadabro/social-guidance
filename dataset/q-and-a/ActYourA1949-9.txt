        "question": "How can I act my age and avoid infantile reactions?",
        "answer": "Acting your age and avoiding infantile reactions involves recognizing situations where you might react in a childish manner and making a conscious effort to behave maturely. For example, when you don't get what you want, instead of throwing a temper tantrum or sulking, try to control your emotions and communicate calmly. When someone disagrees with you or pokes fun at you, remember to respond with maturity and respect, rather than getting defensive or lashing out. Seeking attention, feeling confused, or facing setbacks are all opportunities to practice handling situations like an adult. By rating yourself in these different scenarios and comparing with others' perceptions, you can identify areas where you need to improve. Developing self-awareness and working on controlling your reactions will help you grow emotionally and eliminate infantile behaviors over time."

        "question": "How can I measure my emotional growth and maturity?",
        "answer": "Measuring your emotional growth and maturity involves evaluating your responses in various situations to determine if they align with your actual age or if they reflect infantile reactions. To do this, create a rating system where you assess how you react when faced with disagreements, jokes at your expense, the need for attention, confusion, or disappointment. Ask trusted individuals, such as parents or friends, to provide their perspective on your behavior in these scenarios to gain a more objective view. By comparing your self-assessment with external feedback, you can identify areas where you may need to work on controlling your emotions and responding in a more mature manner. Setting goals to improve your reactions and tracking your progress over time will help you measure your emotional growth and ensure that you are developing evenly across different aspects of your personality."
