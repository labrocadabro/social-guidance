        "question": "How can one cope with the feeling of resentment towards a winner?",
        "answer": "Dealing with feelings of resentment towards a winner can be challenging, but it's essential to address them in a healthy way. Instead of letting negative emotions consume you, try to shift your focus towards understanding why you feel that way. Recognize that jealousy and resentment are natural human emotions, but they don't have to control your actions. Practice empathy by putting yourself in the winner's shoes and acknowledging their hard work and achievements.

By acknowledging and processing your feelings of resentment, you can learn to let go of them and cultivate a more positive and supportive mindset."
