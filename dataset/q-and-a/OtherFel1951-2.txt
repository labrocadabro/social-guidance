        "question": "How should one handle teasing and bullying?",
        "answer": "Teasing and bullying can be hurtful and have a lasting impact. If you find yourself being teased or bullied, it's important to speak up and seek help from a teacher or another trusted adult. Letting the person know that their behavior is unacceptable and asking them to stop can often resolve the situation. If the teasing continues or escalates, it's important to involve others who can help put an end to it. Remember, it's not tattling to seek help when you're being mistreated. On the other hand, if you witness someone being teased or bullied, it's crucial to intervene and stand up for them. Being a supportive friend and standing against bullying behavior can make a huge difference in someone's life. It's important to remember that everyone deserves to feel safe and respected, and it's our responsibility to help create a positive and inclusive environment for everyone."
