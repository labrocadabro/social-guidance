        "answer": "In situations where you feel neglected by others, it's important to communicate your feelings in a constructive manner. Express your concerns or emotions with the individuals involved, and try to understand their perspective as well. It's possible that they may not have intentionally neglected you, but were preoccupied with their own responsibilities. By initiating a dialogue and sharing your feelings openly, you can address any misunderstandings and work towards a resolution. Remember that everyone has their own challenges and may not always be able to give their full attention. Practice patience and empathy when dealing with situations where you feel neglected, and strive to find common ground that benefits all parties involved."
