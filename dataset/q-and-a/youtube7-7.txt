        "question": "Is it right to hide a lawbreaker from justice?",
        "answer": "Hiding a lawbreaker from justice is not the right thing to do. It is important to understand that everyone is accountable for their actions, and helping someone evade the consequences of their behavior only enables them to continue down the wrong path. By shielding a lawbreaker from facing justice, you are essentially condoning their actions and allowing them to avoid taking responsibility for the harm they have caused. It is crucial to remember that justice is an essential component of a functioning society, and everyone must be held accountable for their actions. By upholding the principles of justice and the rule of law, you are contributing to a safer and more just community for everyone."
