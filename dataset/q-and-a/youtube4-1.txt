        "question": "How can I distinguish between relevant and irrelevant facts in a story?",
        "answer": "Distinguishing between relevant and irrelevant facts in a story is essential to maintain accuracy and clarity. Relevant facts are those that directly contribute to the main issue or problem being addressed, while irrelevant facts do not impact the central theme of the story. To differentiate between the two, it is important to focus on facts that are directly related to the subject at hand and avoid including information that does not add value or context to the narrative. False analogies, where two seemingly similar things are compared, should be identified and excluded from the story. By prioritizing facts that are pertinent to the main topic and excluding irrelevant details, you can ensure that your story remains focused and informative."

By being cautious of false analogies and ensuring that comparisons are based on accurate and meaningful similarities, you can prevent misleading conclusions and maintain the integrity of your reporting."
