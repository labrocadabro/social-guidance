        "answer": "To systematize your saving and meet your financial goals, divide your personal allowance into three parts: savings for the future, savings for something you want, and spending for amusement.

Finally, reserve a portion for spending on leisure activities, such as movies or treats. By managing your funds wisely and adhering to this saving system, you learn the value of money and develop responsible financial habits that will serve you well in the future."
