        "question": "How should one dress appropriately for a formal event?",
        "answer": "Dressing appropriately for a formal event involves choosing attire that is formal but in good taste. When acting as a hostess, avoid overly elaborate ensembles and opt for something simple and dignified. Avoid wearing coats, fur coats, gloves, hats, heavy ornaments, or corsages while serving tea. Remember that good taste in dress depends more on line and color than on richness or ornamentation. Dressing formally does not require a large or expensive wardrobe, but it does require learning what is in good taste. Choose clothes that set off your personality to best advantage, and always keep in mind that etiquette and taste must be learned to make a good impression."
