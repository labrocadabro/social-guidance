Consider practicality and logic when positioning items on the table, keeping the convenience of your guests in mind. Avoid stacking cups too high or placing them in a way that could lead to accidents. Plates should be easily reachable for guests without having to move around too much. The placement of spoons and napkins should be done in a staggered manner for easy retrieval. By following these guidelines and showing consideration for your guests, you can create a table setting that is both practical and aesthetically pleasing."
