        "question": "How should I set the table for a social function?",
        "answer": "Setting the table for a social function requires careful consideration and attention to detail. Choose a cloth that is elegant and suitable for the occasion, such as a lace or embroidered cloth. Make sure the cloth is spread smoothly and the centerpiece of flowers is low and harmonizes with the rest of the decorations. When placing candelabra, ensure they are not too high and provide enough light without obstructing the serving area. Use china ware for serving and arrange the tea sets practically so they are easily accessible. Consider the convenience of your guests when placing cups, plates, spoons, and napkins, and avoid stacking items to prevent accidents. The overall goal is to create an attractive, balanced, and efficient table setting that shows consideration for your guests and adds to the enjoyment of the event."
