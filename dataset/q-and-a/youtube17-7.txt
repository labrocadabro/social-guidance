        "answer": "Understanding the difference between real danger and perceived threats is essential in managing fear effectively. Real dangers require precautionary measures and appropriate responses to ensure safety.

Developing the ability to discern between real dangers and perceived threats is key to managing fear in a constructive and rational manner."
