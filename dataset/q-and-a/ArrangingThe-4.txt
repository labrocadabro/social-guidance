        "question": "How can I set a tea table to show politeness and consideration to my guests?",
        "answer": "Setting a tea table to show politeness and consideration to your guests involves attention to detail and thoughtfulness in the arrangement. Start by choosing a tablecloth that is elegant and suited to the occasion, such as a lace or embroidered cloth. Ensure that the cloth is smooth and hangs evenly at the sides. When arranging the table, place a low centerpiece of flowers that harmonize with the rest of the decor. Carefully choose candelabra that are not too high and provide sufficient light without interfering with the serving. Make sure the placement is exact and symmetrical to achieve a sense of balance in the design. Remember that tea is not the only drink that can be served, and the service need not be of silver. Consider using china ware instead. Keep practicality in mind when placing the tea sets within reach for ease of use. Arrange the cups at the right side of the pourer for convenience. Avoid stacking cups too high to prevent accidents and embarrassment. Additionally, place plates where guests can easily pick them up without having to move around too much. The placement of spoons and napkins should be staggered for ease in picking them up. By following these guidelines, you will demonstrate your courtesy, good taste, and friendliness to your guests."
