        "question": "How can I maintain my integrity and avoid cheating?",
        "answer": "Maintaining integrity involves being honest and doing your own work, even when it's challenging. If you're struggling with a concept or assignment, it's important to seek help from a teacher or tutor rather than resorting to cheating. Developing a strong work ethic and study habits can help you feel confident in your abilities and avoid the temptation to cheat.

By staying true to yourself, being responsible for your own work, and seeking help when needed, you can maintain your integrity and build a reputation as a trustworthy individual."

        "question": "How can I be a reliable friend and classmate?",
        "answer": "Being a reliable friend and classmate involves supporting others in a positive and honest way. If a friend asks for help with schoolwork, it's important to assist them in understanding the material rather than giving them the answers. Dependability means being there for your friends and classmates when they need support and encouragement, but not doing their work for them. By fostering a culture of academic integrity and mutual respect, you can create a supportive environment where everyone can learn and grow together. Remember that true friendship is built on trust, honesty, and mutual respect, so it's essential to maintain these qualities in your interactions with others."
