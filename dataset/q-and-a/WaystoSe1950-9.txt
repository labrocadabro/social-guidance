        "question": "How can disputes be settled quickly and fairly?",
        "answer": "Disputes can be settled quickly and fairly by compromising. This means that both parties involved give in a little bit, and then both can have part of what they wanted. For example, when sharing a tricycle, compromise by taking turns driving it or sharing it. Another way to settle disputes is by obeying the rules. There are rules about common property that we share, like a ball and bat, and rules about personal property. By following the rules, many disputes can be prevented. Additionally, disputes can be settled by finding the facts. Sometimes disputes happen because all the facts are not known. Finding the facts can help clear up misunderstandings and resolve conflicts effectively. Lastly, disputes can be settled by finding opinions. This can involve seeking the opinion of an expert or taking a vote to get the opinion of the whole group. By utilizing these different methods, disputes can be resolved in a way that is fair and satisfactory for all parties involved."
