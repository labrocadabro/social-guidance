        "question": "How can perspective help in dealing with challenges?",
        "answer": "Having the right perspective is crucial when facing challenges. By gaining a broader perspective and seeing the problem in relation to one's life as a whole, individuals can better understand the significance of the challenge at hand. In the case of Alice and Marv, having perspective would mean realizing that a promotion or making a sports team is just one aspect of their lives, and not the sole determinant of their worth or success. By getting the facts about the situation, making a plan based on those facts, and then carrying out that plan, individuals can approach challenges with a clearer mindset. This approach helps in reducing stress, focusing on achievable goals, and maintaining a positive attitude. Perspective allows individuals to prioritize what truly matters to them and not get bogged down by temporary setbacks or failures."
