        "question": "How can social controls like customs, moral codes, and laws affect our daily lives?",
        "answer": "Social controls such as customs, moral codes, and laws play a crucial role in guiding our behavior and interactions in society. Customs are the things we usually do, and they help maintain order and routine in our daily lives. They can include habits like being neat and clean or showing courtesy to others. While violating a custom may not have serious consequences, it can affect our social standing and reputation. Moral codes, on the other hand, are deeper societal standards that dictate what we should and should not do. These standards are ingrained in us, and breaking them can lead to social exclusion and loss of status. Laws, the most formal form of social control, are a set of rules enforced by established means. Laws prohibit what society deems wrong and direct what is considered right. They ensure order, safety, and fairness in the community. By adhering to customs, moral codes, and laws, we contribute to a harmonious and functional society."
