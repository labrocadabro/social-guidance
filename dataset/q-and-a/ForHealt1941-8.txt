        "question": "How can I ensure my child grows up healthy and strong?",
        "answer": "Ensuring your child grows up healthy and strong involves providing the right food, sunshine, companionship, and intelligent care from babyhood. It is important to breastfeed your baby since birth, as breast milk is the best food for infants. Daily exercise and sun exposure are also crucial for a child's development. Give babies plenty of space to creep and explore. Allow your child to reach developmental milestones at their own pace and avoid jumping them down before they are ready. Additionally, provide a well-balanced diet that includes foods like milk, oranges, cabbage, potatoes, green and yellow vegetables, dried beans, fruits, whole-grain cereal, eggs, salmon, and bacon, among others. Proper nutrition, exercise, and sunlight will help your child develop strong bones, muscles, and overall good health."
