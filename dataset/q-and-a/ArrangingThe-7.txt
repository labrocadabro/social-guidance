        "question": "How can I ensure a proper tea table setup for social functions?",
        "answer": "To ensure a proper tea table setup for social functions, it is important to pay attention to details and show consideration for your guests. Use a lace or embroidered cloth, or one of Italian cut work, rather than a plain white linen cloth, to add elegance to the occasion. Spread the cloth carefully so it hangs evenly, and choose a low centerpiece of flowers that harmonizes with the rest of the decor. Place candelabra on the table only if they will be lighted and used as the main light source, ensuring they are not too high and do not interfere with the serving. When laying out the tea sets, prioritize practicality by placing items where they can be easily reached and used. Consider the convenience of the pourer by keeping the tea urn, cream, and sugar within reach. Cups should be placed at the right of the pourer for easy access. Avoid stacking cups too high to prevent accidents. Plates should be easily accessible for guests to pick up without having to reach too far. Ensure spoons and napkins are placed singly and staggered for ease of use. By following these guidelines and considering both practicality and guest comfort, you can create an inviting and aesthetically pleasing tea table setup for social functions."
