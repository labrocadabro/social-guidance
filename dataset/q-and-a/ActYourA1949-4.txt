        "question": "How can I ensure I act my age and not display infantile reactions?",
        "answer": "To ensure you act your age and avoid displaying infantile reactions, it's important to reflect on your behavior in different situations. Ask yourself how you react when someone disagrees with you, pokes fun at you, when you want attention, when you are confused, or when you don't get what you want. These are crucial moments to watch out for any childish behavior. One effective method is to rate yourself on these aspects and have others, such as your parents or friends, do the same. By comparing different ratings, you can identify areas where you may be displaying immature reactions and work on improving them. For instance, if you find that you react like a 10-year-old when you don't get what you want, make a conscious effort to control your temper and develop better emotional regulation skills. By consistently monitoring your behavior and actively working on areas where you fall short, you can gradually align your reactions with your actual age and grow up evenly, getting rid of any lingering infantile behaviors."

        "question": "How can I measure my emotional growth and track progress in acting my age?",
        "answer": "Measuring your emotional growth and tracking progress in acting your age involves creating a structured system for self-assessment. Develop a rating sheet that includes key scenarios where infantile reactions may manifest, such as disagreements, jokes at your expense, moments of confusion, or instances of not getting what you want. Rate yourself honestly in each of these situations, considering how your reactions align with your actual age. To gain a comprehensive perspective, ask trusted individuals like family members or friends to provide their ratings as well. Analyze the discrepancies between your self-rating and external ratings to identify areas for improvement. Focus on enhancing emotional regulation skills, such as controlling temper, managing disappointment, and seeking attention appropriately. Set specific goals for growth, such as aiming to respond more maturely in certain scenarios over time. Regularly review your ratings, track progress, and adjust your behavior accordingly to ensure steady emotional development and the reduction of infantile reactions."
