        "question": "When should we share things?",
        "answer": "Sharing is an important aspect of social behavior, but it is also essential to understand when it is appropriate to keep something for oneself. When deciding whether or not to share, consider factors such as the age and safety of the person with whom you are considering sharing. In the case of items that may be dangerous or require a certain level of skill to handle safely, it is perfectly acceptable to keep them for personal use. It is important to strike a balance between sharing and personal ownership, taking into account the well-being and abilities of those involved. Ultimately, the decision to share or not should be based on consideration for others and a sense of responsibility."

        "question": "How do we decide whose turn it is?",
        "answer": "Deciding whose turn it is in a fair and just manner involves establishing rules and adhering to them consistently. One way to determine whose turn it is to do a particular task or activity is to create a system, such as marking turns on a calendar or using a rotation schedule. It is also important to consider factors such as age, ability, and fairness when determining turns. Older individuals may be given certain responsibilities or privileges, while younger individuals may have different tasks assigned to them. By establishing clear rules and following them consistently, individuals can ensure that decision-making is fair and everyone has an equal opportunity to participate. Communication and mutual respect are key components of this process, as they help to avoid conflicts and promote a sense of fairness among all parties involved."
