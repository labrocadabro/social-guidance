        "question": "How can I handle feelings of jealousy or resentment towards others?",
        "answer": "Feelings of jealousy or resentment towards others can be difficult to navigate, but it's important to address these emotions in a healthy and constructive way. Instead of comparing yourself to others or focusing on what they have that you don't, try to shift your perspective and focus on your own strengths and accomplishments. Remember that everyone has their own unique journey and challenges, and it's not productive to measure your worth based on the success or achievements of others. Practicing gratitude and appreciation for what you have can help counteract feelings of jealousy or resentment. Additionally, consider reaching out to a trusted friend or family member to talk about your feelings and gain a different perspective. By acknowledging and addressing your emotions, you can work towards developing a more positive and self-assured mindset."
