        "question": "How can I make sure I am not bothering others when they are busy?",
        "answer": "One way to make sure you are not bothering others when they are busy is to observe their actions and body language. If someone appears focused on a task and not engaging with you, it is best to respect their space and find something else to occupy your time. It's important to recognize when others are preoccupied and to not interrupt them unnecessarily. Additionally, asking politely if they need help or if it is a good time to engage with them can show consideration for their current situation. Remember that everyone has their own responsibilities and priorities, so being mindful of this and finding ways to keep yourself occupied without imposing on others is a key social skill."

        "question": "What should I do if I want to play with someone but they seem busy?",
        "answer": "If you want to play with someone but they seem busy, it's essential to be understanding of their situation. Recognize that everyone has their own tasks and responsibilities to attend to, and it may not be the right time to engage in play. Instead of insisting on playing, you can ask if there is a better time to join them or if there is anything you can do to help with their current activities. Being patient and respectful of their time shows maturity and consideration for their priorities. Remember that it's important to be flexible and adaptable in social interactions, and sometimes waiting for the right moment to engage in play can lead to more enjoyable and meaningful interactions."

        "question": "How can I handle situations where I feel left out or ignored by others?",
        "answer": "Feeling left out or ignored by others can be challenging, but it's important to approach these situations with a positive attitude and open communication. Instead of internalizing these feelings, you can try to understand the perspective of others and consider that they may be preoccupied with their own tasks. If you feel left out, you can take the initiative to find alternative activities to engage in or seek out others who may be more available to interact with. It's also helpful to communicate your feelings openly and honestly with others, expressing your desire to participate without placing blame or making assumptions about their intentions. By being proactive, understanding, and communicative in these situations, you can navigate feelings of being left out and find ways to engage with others in a positive and constructive manner."
