        "question": "How do social controls like custom, moral code, and law affect our daily lives?",
        "answer": "Social controls such as custom, moral code, and law play a significant role in regulating our daily lives. Custom dictates what we usually do, setting the standard for our behavior in various situations. It guides us in how we dress, how we interact with others, and how we carry out our daily activities. Violating customs may result in a loss of prestige, as they are ingrained habits that we follow regularly. Moral code, on the other hand, represents society's standards about what we should and should not do. It is deeply rooted in us and determines our conduct based on what is deemed proper and acceptable by society. Breaking moral codes can lead to a loss of social status and a sense of not belonging. Finally, law is a set of rules for our conduct made by representatives of the people and enforced by established means. Laws prohibit behaviors that the majority deem wrong and direct actions that are considered right. They ensure that we follow certain guidelines for the benefit of both ourselves and society as a whole. Ultimately, social controls like custom, moral code, and law influence our decisions, actions, and interactions on a daily basis, shaping our behavior and helping to maintain social order and harmony."

        "question": "How are social controls related to the activities of the teen canteen?",
        "answer": "The activities of the teen canteen serve as a microcosm of how social controls like custom, moral code, and law impact our behaviors and decisions. Custom, which reflects what is customary and routine, is evident in the canteen's operations. For example, the habit of cleaning up after closing time is a custom that members adhere to, demonstrating their respect for the established norms of the club. Moral code, representing society's standards of right and wrong, is also reflected in the canteen's rules against drinking or gambling. Members are expected to abide by these moral codes to maintain their social standing within the group. Additionally, the implementation of a new law or rule regarding the canteen's closing time exemplifies the influence of formal laws on the club's operations. By setting a closing time of 10:30 pm on weeknights, the canteen members are aligning themselves with the laws of the town and the community's expectations. Through these examples, we can see how social controls directly impact the activities, decisions, and behaviors within the teen canteen, mirroring the broader societal influences that regulate our daily lives."

        "question": "How can social controls help us govern ourselves in a community?",
        "answer": "Social controls, including custom, moral code, and law, play a crucial role in helping us govern ourselves within a community.

Upholding moral codes ensures that individuals act in ways that benefit the community and reflect its collective beliefs. Additionally, formal laws provide a structured framework for governance, setting clear rules and regulations that govern behavior and ensure accountability. By adhering to laws established by representatives of the people, community members can coexist peacefully and resolve conflicts through established means. Ultimately, social controls enable communities to self-regulate, make informed decisions, and work together towards common goals, fostering a sense of unity, responsibility, and respect among its members."
