        "question": "When should we share things?",
        "answer": "Sharing is an important aspect of social behavior, especially when it comes to playing fair. Knowing when to share things can be tricky, but a good rule of thumb is to consider the situation and the needs of others. If you have something that someone else could benefit from or enjoy, it's always a good idea to share.

By being mindful of others' feelings and needs, you can make the decision to share things in a fair and appropriate way."
