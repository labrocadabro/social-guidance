        "question": "How do social controls like custom, moral code, and law impact our daily lives?",
        "answer": "Social controls like custom, moral code, and law play a significant role in regulating our daily lives. Custom dictates what we usually do, while moral code guides us on what we should do. Law, on the other hand, enforces what we must do. These social controls influence our behavior in various settings, such as the teen canteen in the town. For example, the canteen has its own laws about closing time, and members are expected to abide by them. When individuals follow these social controls, they contribute to maintaining social harmony and order within the community. By understanding and respecting these social controls, individuals can navigate their daily interactions with greater awareness and consideration for others."

For instance, in the teen canteen, there are rules against drinking or gambling, aligning with the moral code of the group. Breaking moral codes can result in a loss of social status and a sense of exclusion from the community. By upholding moral codes, individuals demonstrate their commitment to ethical behavior and contribute to the cohesion of their social group."
