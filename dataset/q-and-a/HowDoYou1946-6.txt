        "question": "How can I properly introduce people to each other?",
        "answer": "Properly introducing people to each other involves addressing the person of the opposite sex first. For example, if you are introducing a man to a woman, address the woman first. It is important to watch others who have the correct technique to learn how to do it properly. When introducing individuals of the same sex, you should address the older person first. It is also essential to phrase the introduction in a way that introduces the man to the woman. Remember to avoid awkward introductions like 'meet so-and-so' or 'let me make you acquainted with so-and-so.' When responding to introductions, stick to the accepted form of saying 'how do you do?' Unless there is a good reason to say something else. Acknowledge introductions by making a personal response, such as mentioning something in common or using the person's name in your response. Men should shake hands comfortably with a firm grasp, and women should only offer their hand for a handshake if the man does not initiate it. Remember, the warmth in the greeting and the feeling you put behind it are crucial in making a good impression when introducing people."
