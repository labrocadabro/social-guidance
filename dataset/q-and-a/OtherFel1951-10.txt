        "question": "How can I handle teasing from others?",
        "answer": "Handling teasing from others can be difficult, but it's important to remember not to retaliate or resort to teasing back. Retaliating can often escalate the situation and make things worse. Instead, try to talk to the person teasing you calmly and express how their actions are making you feel. If the teasing continues, it's important to seek help from a teacher, parent, or another trusted adult. Remember, it's never okay for someone to make you feel uncomfortable or hurt, and it's important to stand up for yourself in a respectful way. Surrounding yourself with supportive friends who can help you navigate the situation can also be beneficial. Remember, teasing is not a reflection of who you are, but rather a behavior of the person doing the teasing. By handling teasing with maturity and seeking help when needed, you can navigate these situations in a positive and constructive way."

        "question": "How can I know when teasing crosses the line and becomes harmful?",
        "answer": "Teasing can cross the line and become harmful when it starts to impact someone's well-being and self-esteem. If teasing is causing distress, anxiety, or fear in the person being teased, it is a sign that it has become harmful. Additionally, if the teasing is persistent, targeted, and meant to hurt rather than in a playful manner, it is important to recognize that it has crossed the line. Harmful teasing can lead to emotional and psychological damage, affecting a person's mental health and overall well-being. It's essential to take these signs seriously and address the teasing behavior before it escalates further. Seeking help from a teacher, counselor, or mental health professional can provide support and guidance in dealing with harmful teasing and its effects."
