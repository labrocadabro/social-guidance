        "question": "How can I differentiate between relevant and irrelevant facts?",
        "answer": "To differentiate between relevant and irrelevant facts, it is important to consider whether the information directly relates to the topic or question at hand. Relevant facts provide valuable insight into the issue being discussed and help support your argument or point of view. On the other hand, irrelevant facts do not contribute to the main idea and can distract from the core message. When gathering facts, focus on obtaining information that is essential to understanding the topic and avoid including details that do not add value to your story. By prioritizing relevant facts and excluding irrelevant details, you can present a clear and concise narrative that is informative and engaging."

Avoid making assumptions based on surface-level similarities and instead focus on identifying key differences that may impact the validity of the analogy. Consider whether the comparison holds true in all relevant aspects and be cautious of drawing conclusions based on flawed or misleading analogies. By critically analyzing the similarities and differences between subjects and ensuring that the comparison is valid and relevant, you can strengthen the credibility of your arguments and avoid misleading your audience with false analogies."

Examine the basis for your assumptions and evaluate whether they are well-founded or biased.
