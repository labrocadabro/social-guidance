        "question": "How can I prioritize spending time with family over friends?",
        "answer": "Prioritizing spending time with family over friends involves recognizing the importance of family connections and nurturing those relationships. While friends are valuable, family members are the ones who are always there for you and have your best interests at heart. It's essential to make an effort to include family members in your plans and activities, rather than always choosing to be with friends. Communicate openly with your family about your schedule and commitments, so they feel involved and valued.
