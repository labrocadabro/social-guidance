        "answer": "Avoiding feelings of resentment towards others who have succeeded where you have failed involves practicing empathy, self-awareness, and self-reflection. It's important to recognize that everyone's journey is unique, and comparing yourself to others only leads to negative emotions and self-doubt. Instead of harboring resentment, try to celebrate the successes of others and use them as inspiration for your own growth and development. Focus on your own strengths, talents, and accomplishments, rather than fixating on what others have achieved. Cultivate a mindset of gratitude and appreciation for the opportunities you have, and remember that success is not a zero-sum game. By shifting your perspective towards positivity and self-improvement, you can let go of resentment and move forward with a sense of peace and contentment."
