        "question": "When should we share things?",
        "answer": "Sharing is an important part of being considerate and fair. While it's nice to share with others, it's also important to remember that sometimes it's okay to keep certain things to yourself. You should consider factors like the other person's age, ability, and safety before deciding whether or not to share. It's perfectly acceptable to keep things that are personal or that you earned for yourself. Sharing is a choice, not an obligation, so it's important to strike a balance between being generous and taking care of yourself."
