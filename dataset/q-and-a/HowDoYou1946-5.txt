        "question": "How should introductions be handled in social situations?",
        "answer": "Introductions in social situations should follow a few basic rules to ensure a smooth interaction. When introducing a man to a woman, it is customary to address the woman first. For example, saying, 'Miss Cameron, this is my father. How do you do, Miss Cameron?' If introducing individuals of the same sex, it is polite to address the elder person first. Remember to keep introductions simple and to the point. It is also important to respond to introductions politely by saying, 'How do you do?' in most cases. Additionally, when shaking hands, men should offer a comfortable, firm grasp, while women should initiate a handshake with a man. Rising from a seated position is also a sign of respect, with men rising when someone is brought to be introduced to them, and women rising when introduced to someone standing. Remember, practice and warmth in your greeting are key to successful introductions and making a positive impression on others."
