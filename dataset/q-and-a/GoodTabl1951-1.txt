        "question": "How can I handle different types of foods when dining?",
        "answer": "When dining, it's important to know how to handle different types of foods. Finger foods, such as bread, can be eaten with your hands. For messier or sticky foods, like cream puffs, use a fork. Fork foods include meats, potatoes, vegetables, and salads, which should be eaten with the proper fork technique. Hold your fork correctly, place only one mouthful of food on it, and lay it down if you need to talk. After using your fork, park it neatly on the plate. When using a knife, hold it correctly in your palms and cut meat instead of tearing it. Finish your meal by placing your knife and fork in a specific way to signal you're done. Spoon foods, like soup, should be eaten by dipping the spoon away from yourself and eating from the side of the spoon."
