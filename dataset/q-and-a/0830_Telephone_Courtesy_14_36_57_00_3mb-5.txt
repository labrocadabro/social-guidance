        "question": "How can I ensure proper telephone usage in the office?",
        "answer": "Ensuring proper telephone usage in the office requires a team effort and regular check-ups. Start by making sure your switchboard operator has the time and resources to focus exclusively on handling calls. This allows them to be a welcoming committee for incoming and outgoing calls and ensures a positive experience for callers. Encourage a cooperative effort among all office staff to practice good telephone habits. Display the office's telephone number prominently on letterheads, bill forms, and business cards as part of your telephone address. Regularly check in with staff to remind them of the importance of telephone courtesy and provide suggestions for improvement. By making telephone courtesy a priority and integrating it into daily office routines, you can create a positive telephone culture in the office that benefits both employees and customers. Remember, it's the little things, like prompt attention, thoughtful consideration, and effective action on customer calls, that make a big difference in maintaining proper telephone usage in the office."
