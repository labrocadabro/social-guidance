        "question": "How should I handle introductions in social situations?",
        "answer": "Handling introductions in social situations can be a breeze if you remember a few basic rules. When introducing people of opposite sexes, it's important to address the woman first. This shows respect and proper etiquette. Additionally, make sure to introduce the older or more respected person first when introducing individuals of the same sex. For example, when introducing someone to your teacher or a guest in your home, address them first. Remember to keep introductions simple and to the point, avoiding awkward phrases like 'meet so-and-so'. When responding to an introduction, the accepted form is to simply say 'How do you do?' in a friendly manner. If you want to make the response more personal, like Frank's mother did, you can mention something in common or acknowledge prior knowledge about the person. It's also important to remember that men shake hands with a comfortable, firm grasp, and women should offer their hand first if they wish to shake hands with a man. These basic rules, when followed with warmth and sincerity, will make introductions in social situations a pleasant experience for everyone involved."

        "question": "When should I rise in a social setting?",
        "answer": "Knowing when to rise in a social setting is a key aspect of proper etiquette. In general, a man should rise when being introduced to someone, especially if the person being introduced is a woman. This shows respect and courtesy.

Similarly, a woman should rise when being introduced to someone, especially if the person being introduced is standing. This shows good manners and acknowledges the introduction in a respectful way. It's important to remember that rising in a social setting is a sign of courtesy and should be done with a sense of pleasure, not as a chore. By following these guidelines and practicing proper rising etiquette, you can make a positive impression in social situations and show that you value proper social customs."

Men should wait for a woman to offer her hand for a handshake, and women should initiate the handshake if they wish to shake hands with a man. By following these guidelines and responding to introductions with sincerity and warmth, you can create a positive and pleasant atmosphere in social interactions."
