        "question": "How can I create an aesthetically pleasing table arrangement for a social function?",

Start by choosing a decorative cloth that suits the occasion, such as a lace or embroidered cloth. Make sure the cloth is spread smoothly and that the centerpiece of flowers complements the overall design. When using candles, ensure they are placed low and strategically to provide adequate lighting without interfering with the serving of food. The placement of tea sets, cups, plates, spoons, and napkins should be practical, easily accessible, and aesthetically pleasing. Avoid stacking cups or plates, and stagger spoons and napkins for easy access. The goal is to create a balanced and symmetrical design that is both visually appealing and functional. By paying attention to these details, you show your guests that you value their comfort and enjoyment, while also demonstrating your good taste and courtesy."
