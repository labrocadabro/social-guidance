        "question": "How should one prepare for hosting a formal tea event?",
        "answer": "Preparing for hosting a formal tea event involves learning the basics of etiquette and showing respect to your guests. Start by sending out invitations at least two weeks in advance, providing details like the date, time, and location. The invitation should be clear and simple, serving as a memorandum for your guests to plan on attending. It's important to involve everyone in the writing process to practice and learn. Handwriting should be neat and easily readable, avoiding childish or affected styles. The dress code for formal events should be in good taste, focusing more on line and color rather than ornamentation. As a hostess, simplicity is key, avoiding heavy accessories, hats, or gloves. Remember, good taste doesn't require an expensive wardrobe, but it does require learning what is appropriate for the occasion. Hosting a tea event is an opportunity to show consideration and respect for your guests, making them feel welcomed and appreciated."

        "question": "What are some key behaviors to exhibit when attending a tea party?",
        "answer": "When attending a tea party, it's essential to demonstrate proper etiquette and respect for your host and fellow guests. As a guest, you can either wait to be served or go directly to the tea table yourself. If offered a handshake, wait for the other person to initiate it. Remove your gloves and put away your bag, ensuring you are ready to enjoy the refreshments. Be mindful of the preferences for lemon, cream, or sugar when served tea, or other drinks like coffee or punch. Remember to engage in light conversation and enjoy the company of those around you. When finished, place your plate out of the way, showing consideration for others. By following these simple guidelines, you can ensure a pleasant and enjoyable experience at a tea party."

        "answer": "Choosing appropriate attire for a formal tea event involves understanding the principles of good taste and style. Formal dress should be in good taste, focusing on line and color rather than richness or ornamentation. As a hostess, simplicity is key, avoiding heavy accessories, hats, or gloves. Jewelry should be worn in moderation, and hats are reserved for guests. Remember that the aim is to enhance your personality through your clothing choices.

Good taste in dress depends on line and color, not richness or ornamentation. Remember to keep your attire simple and elegant.
