        "question": "How should I set up a tea table for friends?",
        "answer": "Setting up a tea table for friends is a lovely tradition that involves careful and considerate planning. Start by selecting a cloth that is well-suited for the occasion, such as a lace or embroidered cloth, and ensure it is spread smoothly and beautifully. The centerpiece of flowers should be low and harmonize with the overall color scheme. When placing candelabra, ensure they are not too high and provide sufficient light without obstructing the serving area. Use china ware for serving, and ensure everything is within easy reach for both the pourer and the guests. Cups should be placed at the right of the pourer for easy access. Avoid stacking cups or plates too high to prevent accidents. Additionally, arrange spoons and napkins individually and staggered for convenience. The goal is to create a visually pleasing and practical table setting that allows guests to enjoy their tea and conversation without any interruptions."
