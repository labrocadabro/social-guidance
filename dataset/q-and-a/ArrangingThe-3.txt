        "question": "How should I set up a tea table for guests?",
        "answer": "Setting up a tea table for guests involves careful consideration and attention to detail. Use a lace or embroidered tablecloth that suits the occasion and is pleasing to your friends. Make sure the cloth is spread smoothly and hangs evenly, with a low centerpiece of flowers that harmonize with the rest of the table arrangements. When placing candelabras, ensure they are not too high and provide enough light without interfering with the serving. The placement should be exact and symmetrical to create a balanced design. In terms of serving drinks, tea is not the only option; coffee or punch can also be offered. The practicality of the placement is key, with the tea urn, cream, and sugar conveniently accessible to the pourer. Consider the guest who will pour the tea when placing cups, and avoid stacking cups too high to prevent accidents. Plates should be easily reachable for guests without having to move around. The arrangement should be symmetrical, even if serving different drinks at each end of the table. Pay attention to the placement of spoons and napkins, ensuring they are placed singly and staggered for easy access. Maintain the principles of practicality and consideration for your guests throughout the table setup."
