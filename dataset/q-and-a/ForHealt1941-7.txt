        "question": "How can I ensure my child grows up to be healthy and strong?",
        "answer": "To ensure your child grows up to be healthy and strong, it is essential to provide them with the right food, sunshine, companionship, and intelligent care from babyhood. Breastfeeding your child since birth is highly beneficial, as breast milk is the best food for babies. Encourage daily exercise, starting from a young age, to help develop muscles and bones. Give your baby plenty of space to move and explore. Allow your child to reach developmental milestones at their own pace, such as sitting up or taking their first steps. When it comes to nutrition, make sure to include a variety of foods in their diet, such as milk, oranges, cabbage, potatoes, green and yellow vegetables, dried beans, fruits, whole-grain foods, eggs, fish, and lean meats. Additionally, provide plenty of fresh air, sunlight, and physical activity. By offering an abundant and properly balanced diet, along with essential nutrients and care, your child will have the foundation to grow into a healthy, well-balanced, and efficient individual."
