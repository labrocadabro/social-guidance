        "question": "How can I get to know the children in my class better?",
        "answer": "Getting to know the children in your class involves using your eyes and ears to observe them in various situations, such as during reading circles or when they think they are not being watched. By observing their interactions and behavior, you can learn a lot about each child as an individual. Additionally, reviewing their cumulative records can provide valuable information about their academic performance and any special circumstances they may be facing. Collaborating with other teachers to share insights and compare notes on the children can also help paint a more complete picture. Making an effort to connect with the children on a personal level, such as through small gestures like complimenting them or engaging them in conversation, can go a long way in building trust and understanding. Overall, taking a multi-faceted approach that combines observation, record review, collaboration, and personal interaction can help you get to know the children in your class better."
