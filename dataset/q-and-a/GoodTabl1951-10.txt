        "question": "How can I improve my table manners?",
        "answer": "Improving your table manners involves following simple rules and using common sense. Always remember to seat the lady first, wait for her to be seated before sitting down, and order your meal after she has ordered hers. When eating, use your knife and fork properly, taking care not to make a mess. Finish your meal by placing your knife and fork in a specific way to show you're done. When eating spoon foods like soup, remember to dip the spoon away from yourself and eat from the side of the spoon. Show courtesy and consideration towards others, such as not tipping the bowl when eating soup or eating too much from the spoon. Practice good table manners regularly at home so they come naturally when dining out. Pay attention to others with good manners, like your parents, to learn proper table etiquette. The key is to use common sense, be considerate of others, and good table manners will become second nature."
