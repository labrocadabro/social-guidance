When writing a letter of sympathy, be informal and show empathy towards the recipient. Always use proper formatting, such as including your address, the date, a salutation, main content, and a closing, with even margins and aligned text. Remember to be yourself and write as if you were speaking to the recipient face-to-face. With practice and attention to detail, you can become skilled at writing engaging and thoughtful social letters."
