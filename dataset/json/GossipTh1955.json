Facts are based on verifiable information that can be proven, such as firsthand accounts, documents, or credible sources. Gossip, on the other hand, is often based on rumors, speculation, or hearsay, without any concrete evidence to back it up. One way to determine if something is a fact or gossip is to consider the source of the information. If the information comes from a reliable and trustworthy source, it's more likely to be a fact. However, if the information is being spread by someone who is known for exaggerating or spreading rumors, it's likely just gossip. It's also important to consider the context in which the information is being shared. Facts are usually presented in a straightforward and objective manner, while gossip can be sensationalized or embellished for dramatic effect. By being critical of the information you receive and checking for evidence to support it, you can better distinguish between facts and gossip."}, {"question": "What should you do if you hear gossip about a friend?", "answer": "If you hear gossip about a friend, it's important to handle the situation with care and consideration.
