By actively participating in discussions, providing feedback, and suggesting changes when needed, individuals can help shape rules that are more effective, fair, and inclusive. Working together with others to identify areas for improvement, address concerns, and propose solutions can lead to the development of rules that better serve the needs of the community as a whole. By taking an active role in the rule-making process, individuals can help create a more positive and equitable environment for everyone."}]
